          <p>The staff have been trained/retrained/given instruction/are under
          revised supervisory arrangements</p>

          <p>The points raised by the Environmental Health Officers were acted
          upon immediately and we look forward to welcoming them back for
          a re-inspection when we will be delighted to demonstrate our high
          standards at this restaurant.</p>

          <p>The conditions found at the time of the inspection were not typical
          of the normal conditions mainained at the establishment and arose
          because: Historically, cooking temperature records were available.
          However, on the day of the inspection this was not the case.”</p>
